; This file is included after the helper_function file, and takes care of prepping a WINEPREFIX
; (or windows install) or AutoHotKey tests. Really, all it does it create the %APPINSTALL%
; directories and remove old temp stuff, as a precaution. Later, it may be extended to disable
; user input during the tests, or do other pre test stuff, if the need arises.

; This takes the name of the ahk script that includes init_test (e.g., notepad.ahk), then trims 
; off the last 4 characters (.ahk), and stores the result in the variable 'testname'.
; This way, we don't have to set 'testname' in each script, it's automatically determined by the filename.
